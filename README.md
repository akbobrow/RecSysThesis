### Thesis Abstract

Every day, millions of users utilize their mobile phones to access music streaming services such as Spotify.
Despite their popularity, these music recommender systems often lack transparency.
These "black boxes" seldom provide adequate enough supporting explanations which would allow users to understand the algorithms behind their music recommendations.
In recent years, research has unveiled that aspects such as explanations and interface design choices can have just as much of an effect on how people perceive recommendations as algorithm accuracy.
Yet upon completing a systematic literature review, little seems to be known about how to apply these user-centric design approaches to mobile devices.
Additionally, many studies outside of recommender systems have looked at the strong relationship between music and moods, but not a lot of research has been completed on exploiting affective data for music recommendations despite overwhelmingly positive results.
In order to bridge these gaps, Raimundo Herrera's designs created for the Moodplay (Andjelkovic 2019) application were extended upon and applied as non-interactive designs in a mobile setting. 
The main within-subjects Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) study asked participants to compare three interface designs: a baseline, a textual explanatory interface, and a visual explanatory interface (n=178).
Three separate MTurk surveys were conducted, each displaying a different playlist with either low, medium, or high music popularity.
Results indicate that moods are an acceptable way to explain music recommendations.
The use of affective information may help systems become more efficient, transparent, trustworthy, and satisfactory.
Music familiarity may influence the need for explanations in a mobile setting.
While the design consequences of this are unclear, a small positive correlation has been found between music familiarity and the preference for precise textual explanations.
In terms of visual explanation designs, they were deemed more attractive and took less time to understand.
Overall, both explanatory designs fared equally better than the baseline.
Ultimately, while explanations are important to the majority of users, there does not seem to be a one design fits all solution for them.
