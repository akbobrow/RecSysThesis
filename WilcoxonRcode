The following is an example of the code used in RStudio to collect the p-values.
This example takes user results from within survey 1 for the textual explanatory interface design and the visual explanatory interface design, comparing them to one another.

wilcox.test(s_159 ~ Group, data=s1textviz, name=c('Text','Viz'), conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")
wilcox.test(s_160 ~ Group, data=s1textviz, name=c('Text','Viz'), conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")
etc etc...

s_159 and s_160 etc refers to question numbers 159 and 160 found in the csv files. 
(Note: s stands for spørsmål which means question in Norwegian).

Group refers to user responses for either the 'Text' or 'Viz' group.
'Text' refers to the textual explanatory interface and 'Viz' refers to the visual explanatory interface.

The name of the file uploaded to RStudio with raw data is called s1textviz.
This csv file has also been uploaded to the reposity as an example file.
